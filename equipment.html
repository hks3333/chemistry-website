                Beakers are cylindrical utensils made up of borosilicate glass, with a flat bottom and the upper opening having a rim around it along with a spout.<br><br>
                The spout on their rim’s aids in the proper pouring of solutions and they do not have any covering on the top.<br><br>
                Most of the time watch glasses are used to cover their solutions.<br><br>
                They are of varying sizes and are used to hold, heat, or mix substances with a proper measure.<br><br>
                They come with graduated calibrations, they are not meant for precise calculations of solutions, and as such other apparatus come handy in this.<br><br>
